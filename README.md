# Tagger

A small group of python3 scripts to process tv shows and movies with proper metatag data for itunes importation.
Essentially I use these apps in a work flow of Handbrake -> scripts -> itunes.

Both scripts are working:

`movie_tagger.py` is working with file formats of `File Title.Year.Quality.m4v` as an example `Leviathan.1989.1080p.m4v`.
A similar format include season and episode are used for the `tvshow_tagger.py`.
